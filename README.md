# Informations

I started to learn c++ and this project is my main project to understand the working of this language.
In this project i make a basic 2D game engine for my basic game idea.

# Engine

In first place my goal is to make a 2D engine.

# Game

In the game you just travel between villages as demon hunter and you have to solve the village events.
Currently this is the base idea. When the engine have some features than i started to think about this more what have to add to this game. But currently i start with this.



This project is not a school project and not a life project. That means i working on it when i have free time.
